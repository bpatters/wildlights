Wild Lights LED controller

This project is a prototype and has been worked on primarily as a learning project. It is not "release" quality in any way
shape or form.

This project has multiple pieces:
- eagle/ledcontroller
  - The Eagle files for the circuit board for the LED controller.
- nrfworksapce 
  - The Workspace project for the firmware for the NRF51822
- xcode/wildlights 
  - The iOS software prototype to test the BLE connection to the board and animations.

The Fusion 360 models to print the connectors and cases are not part of this project, still thinking about the best way to share
them.
